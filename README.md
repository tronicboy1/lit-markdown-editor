# About this Package

This package is a web component written using Lit to provide simple tools for writing markdown in the browser.

Most markdown tools are very complicated; this component aims to offer a very unsophisticated solution.

# Dependencies

This package uses [Lit](https://lit.dev/) as a basis for the web component.
